      <h1 className="font-cal">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2 className="font-cal">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        It is very important to us to handle the data of our visitors and users
        with confidence and to protect them in the best possible way. For this
        reason, we make every effort to comply with the requirements of the
        GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following, we explain how we process your data at ownAI. We use
        the clearest and most transparent language possible so that you really
        understand what happens with your data.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-cal">2. General information</h2>
      <h3 className="font-cal">
        2.1. Processing of personal data and other terms
      </h3>
      <p>
        Data protection applies to the processing of personal data. Personal
        data means all data with which you can be personally identified. This
        is, for example, the IP address of the device (PC, laptop, smartphone,
        etc.) in front of which you are currently sitting. Such data is
        processed when &apos;something happens to it&apos;. For example, the IP
        is transmitted from the browser to our provider and stored there
        automatically. This is a processing (according to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) of
        personal data (according to Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>These and other legal definitions can be found in Art. 4 GDPR.</p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">
        2.2. Applicable regulations/laws - GDPR, BDSG and TTDSG
      </h3>
      <p>
        The scope of data protection is regulated by laws. In this case, these
        are the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) as a European
        regulation and the BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act) as a national law
        in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the TTDSG supplements the provisions from the GDPR as far
        as the use of cookies is concerned.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">2.3. The person in charge</h3>
      <p>
        The person responsible for data processing is the controller within the
        meaning of the GDPR. This is the natural or legal person who alone or
        jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing
        of personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can reach the responsible person under:

      <h3 className="font-cal">2.4. How data is processed at ownAI</h3>
      <p>
        As we have already established, there are data (e.g. IP address) that
        are collected automatically. This data is mainly required for the
        technical provision of the website and web application. If we use
        personal data or collect other data, we will inform you about it or ask
        for your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other personal data you share with us consciously. You will find more
        detailed information below.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">2.5. Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for
        example, free information about the origin, recipient and purpose of
        your stored personal data. You can also request the rectification,
        blocking or erasure of this data or lodge a complaint with the competent
        data protection supervisory authority. You can revoke your consent at
        any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find out in detail what these rights are and how to exercise
        them in the last section of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">2.6. Data protection - Our view</h3>
      <p>
        Data protection is more than just a chore for us! Personal data is of
        great value and careful handling of this data should be a matter of
        course in our digitalized world. In addition, you as a visitor or user
        should be able to decide for yourself what happens to your data, when
        and by whom. Therefore, we commit ourselves to comply with all legal
        requirements, collect only the data necessary for us and treat them
        confidentially.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">2.7. Disclosure and deletion</h3>
      <p>
        The transfer and deletion of data are also important and sensitive
        topics. Therefore, we would like to briefly inform you in advance about
        our general approach to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        A transfer of data only takes place on the basis of a legal basis and
        only if this is unavoidable. This may be the case in particular if it is
        a so-called Data Processor and a Data Processing Agreement has been
        concluded in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        We delete your data when the purpose and the legal basis for processing
        cease to exist and the deletion is not contrary to any other legal
        obligations. A good overview of this is also provided by Art. 17 GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        For further information, please refer to this Privacy Policy and contact
        the responsible person if you have any specific questions.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">2.8. Hosting</h3>
      <p>
        This web application is hosted externally. The personal data collected
        on this web application is stored on the hoster&apos;s servers. This
        includes the automatically collected and stored log files (see below for
        more details), as well as all other data provided by the web application
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        External hosting is used for the purpose of secure, fast and reliable
        provision of our web application and in this context serves the
        fulfillment of contracts with our potential and existing customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a, b and f GDPR,
        as well as Section 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar as consent includes the storage
        of cookies or access to information in the terminal device of the web
        application visitor or user as defined by the TTDSG.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hoster only processes data that is necessary for the fulfillment of
        its service obligation and acts as our Data Processor, which means that
        it is subject to our instructions. We have concluded a corresponding
        Data Processing Agreement with our hoster.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the following hoster: <br />

      <h3 className="font-cal">2.9. Legal basis</h3>
      <p>
        The processing of personal data always requires a legal basis. The GDPR
        provides for the following possibilities in Art. 6 (1) Sentence 1:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of
          personal data concerning him/her for one or more specific purposes;
        </li>
        <li>
          the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
          the data subject is party or for the implementation of pre-contractual
          measures taken at the data subject&apos;s request;
        </li>
        <li>
          processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
          which the person in charge subject to;
        </li>
        <li>
          the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of
          the data subject or another natural person;
        </li>
        <li>
          processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
          the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
          inthe person in charge was transferred;
        </li>
        <li>
          processing is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding the
          legitimate interests of the responsible person(s) or of a/an third
          party necessary, unless the interests or fundamental rights and
          freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal
          data override this, in particular where the data subject is a child.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the following sections, we will provide you with the specific legal
        basis for the respective processing.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-cal">3. What happens on our web application</h2>
      <p>
        By visiting our website and/or using our web application, we process
        personal data about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect this data as best as possible against unauthorized access by
        third parties, we use SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize this
        encrypted connection by the fact that a https:// or a lock symbol is
        displayed in the address bar of your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following, you will learn which data is collected when you visit
        our website and/or use our web application, for what purpose this is
        done and on what legal basis.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">
        3.1. Data collection when calling up the website and/or using the web
        application
      </h3>
      <p>
        By calling up the website and/or using the web application, information
        is automatically stored in so-called server log files. This is the
        following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is temporarily required in order to be able to display our
        website to you permanently and without problems. In particular, this
        data serves the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>System security of the website and web application</li>
        <li>System stability of the website and web application</li>
        <li>Website and web application troubleshooting</li>
        <li>Connecting to the website and web application</li>
        <li>Website and web application presentation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The data processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1
        lit. f GDPR and is based on our legitimate interest in the processing of
        this data, in particular the interest in the functionality of the
        website and web application as well as its security.
      </p>
      <p>
        If possible, this data is stored pseudonymously and deleted after the
        respective purpose has been achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as the server log files allow the identification of the person
        concerned, the data is stored for a maximum period of 14 days. An
        exception exists if a security-relevant event occurs. In this case, the
        server log files are stored until the elimination and final
        clarification of the security-relevant event.
      </p>
      <p>A consolidation with other data does not take place.</p>

      <h3 className="font-cal">3.5. Analysis and tracking tools</h3>
      <h4 className="font-cal">3.5.1. Vercel Analytics</h4>
      <p>
        We integrate the functions of Vercel Analytics on our website and web
        application. This is a service of Vercel Inc, 440 N Barranca Ave Suite
        4133 Covina, CA 91723 United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vercel Analytics provides near real-time insights into website traffic
        based on actual visitor data. The platform provides detailed insights
        into site usage, such as most visited pages, top referrer sites and
        demographics, and integrates continuous performance measurements into
        the development process to monitor and optimize performance related to
        new deployments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data points (e.g. page views, user-defined events) are recorded
        anonymously so that data can be viewed without being linked or
        associated with a person, a customer or an IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vercel Web Analytics does not collect or store any information that
        would allow an end user&apos;s browsing session to be reconstructed
        across different applications or websites and/or personally identify an
        end user.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Vercel Web Analytics, website traffic can be tracked and valuable
        insights gathered without using third-party cookies. Instead, end users
        are identified by a hash created from the incoming request. The lifetime
        of a visitor session is not stored permanently, but is automatically
        discarded after 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We
        have a legitimate interest in the analysis to ensure the technical
        stability and maximum performance of our website and web application.
        When data is transferred to the USA, the EU Commission&apos;s standard
        contractual clauses (SCC) apply to ensure an appropriate level of data
        protection.

      <h3 className="font-cal">3.6. Payment services</h3>
      <h4 className="font-cal">3.6.1. Stripe</h4>
      <p>
        We use Stripe on this web application. Stripe provides technology for
        the operation of online payment systems. This service is provided by
        Stripe Payments Europe Limited, 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal
        Dock, Dublin, D02 H210, Ireland Attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of payment processing, the payment data of the user is
        processed by Stripe as soon as a contractual relationship is established
        via this web application. Stripe&apos;s respective contractual and data
        protection provisions apply to the respective transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stripe also uses cookies to collect data. These cookies are only set
        with your consent. The consent can be revoked at any time. The legal
        basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the legal basis for processing by Stripe is Art. 6 (1) lit. b
        GDPR. The data is processed for the purpose of contractual obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have a legitimate interest in processing this data within the
        meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR to ensure a fast and reliable payment
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for data
        processing.

      <h2 className="font-cal">4. This is also important</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, we would like to inform you in detail about your rights and how
        you will be informed about changes in data protection requirements.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-cal">4.1. Your Rights in detail</h3>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.1. Right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        You can request information about whether your personal data is being
        processed. If this is the case, you can request further information
        about the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in
        Art. 15 (1) a) to h) GDPR.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.2. Right to rectification according to Art. 16 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        This right includes the correction of inaccurate data and the completion
        of incomplete personal data.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.3. Right to deletion according to Art. 17 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        This so-called &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; gives you the right,
        under certain conditions, to demand the deletion of personal data by the
        controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data
        processing has ceased to exist, if consent has been revoked or if the
        initial processing took place without a legal basis. You can find a
        detailed list of reasons in Art. 17 (1) lit. a to f GDPR. Furthermore,
        this &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; corresponds with the obligation
        of the controller under Art. 17 (2) GDPR to take appropriate measures to
        bring about a general erasure of the data.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.4. Right to restriction of processing according to Art. 18 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18(1)(a) to (d).
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.5. Right to data portability according to Art. 20 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        Here, the basic right to receive one&apos;s own data in a common form
        and to transfer it to another data controller is regulated. However,
        this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a
        contract pursuant to Art. 20 (1) (a) and (b) and to the extent that this
        is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.6. Right of objection according to Art. 21 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        You can generally object to the processing of your personal data. This
        applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the
        legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the
        processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.7. Right to &quot;decision in individual cases&quot; according to
        Art. 22 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        You generally have the right not to be subject to a decision based
        solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces
        legal effects vis-à-vis you or similarly significantly affects you.
        However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in
        Art. 22 (2) and (4) GDPR.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">4.1.8. Other rights</h4>
      <p>
        The GDPR includes comprehensive rights to inform third parties whether
        or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. This,
        however, only insofar as this is also possible or feasible with a
        reasonable effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, we would like to inform you once again of your right to
        withdraw your consent in accordance with Article 7 (3) of the GDPR.
        However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried
        out up to that point.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we would like to inform you about your rights according to
        §§ 32 ff. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights
        just described.
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-cal">
        4.1.9. Right of appeal according to Art. 77 GDPR
      </h4>
      <p>
        You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory
        authority if you consider that a processing of personal data concerning
        you infringes this Regulation.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-cal">5. What if changes take place?</h2>
      <p>
        The current status of this Privacy Policy is 14.03.2024. From time to
        time it is necessary to adapt the content of the Privacy Policy in order
        to react to actual and legal changes. We therefore reserve the right to
        amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will publish the amended
        version in the same place and recommend that you read the Privacy Policy
        regularly.
